### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

H0: If the average percentage of weight loss for the test cample same or less than control sample after a month.

H0: Pt <= Pc

Ha: The average percentage of weight lost by the sample on exercise is greater or the same as by the sample on a diet alone

H1: Pt > Pc

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

For the smoking mothers, the IQ test score for children is the same or higher at ages 1, 2, 3, 4, if 

H0: Mean IQ scores for children whose mothers smoe (10 or more cigarettes a day) during pregnancy are same as mean for those whose mothers do not smoke. 

H1: Mean IQ scores for children whose mothers smokes (10 or more cigarettes a day) during pregnancy are higher or lower 
than those mothers do not smoke.

**Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

H0: if the vicinity thin center of diameter of 10 miles that does not have a grocery stores, farmers' markets, or healthy food 
provides, the diabetes rate is identical to the one that has one. 

H1: there is higher incidence of diabetes in proximity of food deserts.
