# HOMEWORK 3

## Assignment 1

The goal of the first assignment is by plotting multiple distributions with same mean to show that central limit theorem.

To achieve this, an array filled with integers between 10 and 2000 is generated. Then sample of sizes in the integer array 
is sampled from the distributions.

Then the means of each sample is stored in the dictionary and plotted. The means should approach the mean of the distribution 
from which the samples are generated. 

## Assignment 2

Working with the citi bike data. Prepare the data by importing into notebook and preparing the data for the analysis for 
hypothesis test. 

The data is first imported and all columns except the two relevent (gender and birth year) are eliminated from the table. 
Then the ratio of age group by the 

## Assignment 3

This assignment requires to read the times.txt file which is downloaded to the PUIdata folder on compute. The file is 
imported as a dataframe and converted to a numpy array. The mean and standard deviation is computed for numpy array. Then
the Z score is computed for the dataset. 

## Conclusion

Some code references are made to Professor Bianco's lab sessions.
